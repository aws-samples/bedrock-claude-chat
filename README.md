# Bedrock Claude Chat

Êó•Êú¨Ë™û„ÅØ[„Åì„Å°„Çâ](./docs/README_ja.md)

This repository is a sample chatbot using the Anthropic company's LLM [Claude 2](https://www.anthropic.com/index/claude-2), one of the foundational models provided by [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) for generative AI. **As of August 2023, Bedrock is under preview, and applications are required for usage.** This sample is currently developed for use by Japanese speakers, but it is also possible to speak to the chatbot in English.

## Architecture

It's an architecture built on AWS managed services, eliminating the need for infrastructure management. Utilizing Amazon Bedrock, there's no need to communicate with APIs outside of AWS. This enables deploying scalable, reliable, and secure applications.

- [Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/): NoSQL database for conversation history storage
- [Amazon API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/) + [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/): Backend API endpoint ([AWS Lambda Web Adapter](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-web-adapter), [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/))
- [Amazon CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/) + [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/): Frontend application delivery ([React](https://react.dev/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/))
- [Amazon Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/): User authentication
- [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/): Managed service to utilize foundational models via APIs

- Syntax highlighting for code
- Rendering of Markdown

## Deployment

### Prerequisites

- **As of August 2023, Bedrock is under preview, and applications are required for usage.**

### üöÄ Easy Deployment

- Open [CloudShell](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/home)
- Clone this repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/bedrock-claude-chat.git
```

- Run deployment via following commands

```sh
cd bedrock-claude-chat
chmod +x bin.sh
./bin.sh
```

- After about 10 minutes, you will get the following output, which you can access from your browser

```
Frontend URL: https://xxxxxxxxx.cloudfront.net
```

The sign-up screen will appear as shown above, where you can register your email and log in.

### Deploy using CDK

Easy Deployment uses [AWS CodeBuild](https://aws.amazon.com/codebuild/) to perform deployment by CDK internally. This section describes the procedure for deploying directly with CDK.

- Please have UNIX commands and a Node.js runtime environment. If not, you can also use [Cloud9](https://github.com/aws-samples/cloud9-setup-for-prototyping)
- Clone this repository

```
git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/bedrock-claude-chat
```

- Install npm packages

```
cd bedrock-claude-chat
cd cdk
npm ci
```

- Install [AWS CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/)

```
npm i -g aws-cdk
```

- Before deploying the CDK, you will need to work with Bootstrap once for the region you are deploying to. In this example, we will deploy to the us-east-1 region

```
cdk bootstrap us-east-1
```

- If necessary, edit the following entries in [cdk.json](. /cdk/cdk.json) if necessary.

  - `bedrockRegion`: Region where Bedrock is available.
  - `bedrockEndpointUrl`: URL of the Bedrock endpoint.

- Deploy this sample project

```
cdk deploy --require-approval never
```

- You will get output similar to the following. The URL of the web app will be output in `BedrockChatStack.FrontendURL`, so please access it from your browser.

```sh
 ‚úÖ  BedrockChatStack

‚ú®  Deployment time: 78.57s

Outputs:
BedrockChatStack.AuthUserPoolClientIdXXXXX = xxxxxxx
BedrockChatStack.AuthUserPoolIdXXXXXX = ap-northeast-1_XXXX
BedrockChatStack.BackendApiBackendApiUrlXXXXX = https://xxxxx.execute-api.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com
BedrockChatStack.FrontendURL = https://xxxxx.cloudfront.net
```

## Others

### Configure text generation parameters

Edit [config.py](./backend/config.py) and run `cdk deploy`.

```py
GENERATION_CONFIG = {
    "max_tokens_to_sample": 500,
    "temperature": 0.0,
    "top_k": 250,
    "top_p": 0.999,
    "stop_sequences": ["Human: ", "Assistant: "],
}
```
