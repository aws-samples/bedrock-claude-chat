# Local development

## Backend Development

See [backend/README](../backend/README.md).

## Frontend Development

In this sample, you can locally modify and launch the frontend using AWS resources (`API Gateway`, `Cognito`, etc.) that have been deployed with `cdk deploy`.

1. Refer to [Deploy using CDK](../README.md#deploy-using-cdk) for deploying on the AWS environment.
2. Copy the `frontend/.env.template` and save it as `frontend/.env.local`.
3. Fill in the contents of `.env.local` based on the output results of `cdk deploy` (such as `BedrockChatStack.AuthUserPoolClientIdXXXXX`).
4. Execute the following command:

```zsh
cd frontend && npm ci && npm run dev
```

### Using Streaming

Currently, the environment variable `VITE_APP_USE_STREAMING` is specified on the frontend side. It's recommended to set it to `false` when running the backend locally and `true` when operating on AWS.  
When streaming is enabled, text is generated in real-time due to the streaming of content generation results.

## Using docker compose

If you prefer to handle all of resources as Docker, [docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml) allows you to run and develop frontend / backend APIs / DynamoDB Local in your local environment.

```bash
# Build containers
docker compose build

# Launch containers
docker compose up

# Stop containers
docker compose down
```
